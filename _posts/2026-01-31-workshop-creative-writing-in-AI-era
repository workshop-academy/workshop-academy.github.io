### What is AI? 
It is like a growing word snake—each word stretches the story! Check the fun game out!

### AI Rule:

<ul>
<li> Rule 1: Never use AI when it is not allowed — and definitely no cheating at school. </li>
<li> Rule 2: Always think for yourself first. AI can help with ideas, but you make the final decisions. </li>
<li> Rule 3: Keep personal information private. Do not share your full name, address, school, or phone number with AI. </li>
<li> Rule 4: Ask an adult if something feels odd or confusing.** If AI says something strange or wrong, talk to a trusted grown‑up. </li>
<li> Rule 5: Use AI kindly and responsibly. Don’t use AI to spread rumors, bully others, or create hurtful messages. </li>
<li> Rule 6: Be curious, have fun, and stay safe. AI is a great helper when used wisely. </li>

</ul>
