### AI Rule:

<ul>

- **Rule 1:** Never use AI when it is not allowed — and definitely **no cheating at school**.
- **Rule 2:** Always **think for yourself first**. AI can help with ideas, but **you make the final decisions**.
- **Rule 3:** **Keep personal information private.** Do not share your full name, address, school, or phone number with AI.
- **Rule 4:** **Ask an adult if something feels odd or confusing.** If AI says something strange or wrong, talk to a trusted grown‑up.
- **Rule 5:** **Use AI kindly and responsibly.** Don’t use AI to spread rumors, bully others, or create hurtful messages.
- **Rule 6:** **Be curious, have fun, and stay safe.** AI is a great helper when used wisely.
